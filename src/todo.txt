make air density falloff stop lagging the simulation
    (it is currently disabled because running exp() on every aerodynamic_surface is very slow) {
    probably just cache it in a hashmap.. more than good enough
    maybe also make the sky darken with altitude {
        not sure whether to do it by altitude or by density because density is 1000 in water and that's different...
        density -> (sky color, fog) would make sense so that water could be foggy
    }
}

fix water physics (the common physics bug of applying more drag than is possible) {
    create either a bullshitted solution or start the venture into solver-type physics
        (I guess not "start" because the collider velocity cancellation has a solver)
}

get rid of simulation_state
    (it's nice in theory but it's an abandoned implementation of variable settings and it's getting in the way of things) {
    I can add it back later in the cleanup branch when I know what I want from it better and I can make it up-to-date
}

optimize collisions (both between two meshes and between meshes and points) {
    the f16 touching the ground/runway slows the simulation to 100% time usage
    the f16 inside the bowl (sphere... i never got around to making it a bowl) {
        make it a bowl or rename it
    } lags despite having no collisions due to inoptimal/insufficient early paths
    creating just a few aim9x's lags the simulation now, not sure why
}
optimize rotating collision meshes (it is like 50% of the cpu time in -Og)
prettify terrain (shore, maybe some water depth)

add fog? (but I don't want to deal with OpenGL slop right now)
make objects decrease in height like terrain too?
    (transfer the quadratic height drop to the OpenGL side of the renderer-physics_object connector)

figure out interfaces between the
