[Note: These instructions are just notes for me, this is not meant to be a README, though you can use the commands below to compile source using MSYS2 MinGW64.]

to compile, open MSYS2 MinGW64 in new-engine and enter the commands below.

when at most files are changed:
[run from /new_engine]
cmake --build build_release
cmake --build build_debug
[or run from directory directly]
cmake --build .

when (re)creating the /build_[...]/ directory or changing CMakeLists.txt:
[run from /new_engine]
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -B build_release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -B build_debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..




[run from /new_engine/build_[...]] for all the rest

to use address sanitizer use drmemory.exe -- ./main.exe
(replace the -g with -gdwarf-2 to have the right debugging format for line numbers to show)

to start xperf (admin): xperf -on PROC_THREAD+LOADER+PROFILE -f profile.etl -stackwalk Profile

or: xperf -start "NT Kernel Logger" -on PROC_THREAD+LOADER+PROFILE -stackwalk Profile


to start recording with xperf: ./main.exe 

to stop xperf (method 1): xperf.exe -stop my_trace -stop -d merged_trace.etl

to stop xperf (method 2): xperf -d trace.etl


gdb get object inside shared_ptr:
print (the_shared_ptr._M_t)
then take the address of [0]:
print *(T*)0x12345678
^ that is the object

use Very Sleepy to measure time

use procdump with "procdump64.exe -t main.exe" to make postmortem dumps in .dmp,
which WinDbg can open, which can read the failing function upon segfault but not the line numbers


how to log mutex events in gdb:
copy paste all the below

break WaitForSingleObject
y
commands
    silent
    #finish
    if $rax == 0
        printf "[LOCK ACQUIRED] Thread ID=%u", (unsigned int) GetCurrentThreadId()
    else
        printf "[LOCK ATTEMPT] Thread ID=%u", (unsigned int) GetCurrentThreadId()
    end
    continue
end
break ReleaseMutex
y
commands
    silent
    printf "[LOCK RELEASED] Thread ID=%u", (unsigned int) GetCurrentThreadId()
    continue
end
